# Contributing to Config File

The preferred workflow is via pull requests for code changes.

If you find a bug or want to suggest an improvement, etc., please open a issue.
This will make sure it gets noticed. You're also welcome to submit a pull request in this repository.

Here are some guidelines to keep in mind when submitting a pull request:

- Commit history: Try to keep a clean commit history so it is easier to
  see your changes. Keep functional changes and refactorings in separate commits.

- Commit messages: Have a short one line summary of your change followed by as many
  paragraphs of explanation as you need. This is the place to clarify any subtleties
  you have in your impleme∆íntation, document other approaches you tried that didn't
  end up working, any limitations on your implementation, etc. The most important
  part here is to describe _why_ you made the change you did, not simply _what_ the
  change you made is.

- Changelog: Please ensure to update the changelog by adding a new bullet under
  an `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, or `Security` section
  headers under the `Unreleased` version when applicable. If any of those sections
  are not present, feel free to add the one you need. See
  [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) if you need guidance
  on what makes a good entry since this project follows those principles.

- Ensure the tests pass: `poetry run task test` to run all tests.

- New features should be accompanied with tests for them:

  - Unit tests are written using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).

- Pre-commit pipeline: There is a pre-commit pipeline to enforce standard code format.

  Make sure to install pre-commit before making commits.

  ```
  $ pre-commit install
  ```

  Note: if any of the items had to do any reformatting, sorting, etc., the commit will
  fail. You'll have to re-add the items it fixed and try again.

- CI Pipeline: There is a CI pipeline that is run on commits and pull requests that
  ensures the tests pass.

To get started, make sure you have poetry installed and run `poetry install -E yaml -E toml` and `poetry shell` to enter the virtual environment.
